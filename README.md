## Getting started

1. Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Open a new terminal from the VS Code menu - `Terminal > New Terminal`
3. In your new terminal, type the following and hit return:

```sh
npm i
```

This process will take a while, so be patient 😴⏰

4. Once you see the message that everything has been installed, type the
   following into the terminal and hit return:

```sh
npm run setup
```

Again, this will take a while, so be patient 😴⏰

5. Finally, from the terminal again, type:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This project is intended to be a learning resource for developers and students.
